    <h1>Information About CSS</h1>
    <p>Cascading Style Sheets is a style sheet language used for 
        describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML. 
        CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.
        CSS can be used for very basic document text styling — for example, for changing the color and size of headings and links. 
        It can be used to create a layout — for example, turning a single column of text into a layout with a main content area and a
         sidebar for related information. It can even be used for effects such as animation.
